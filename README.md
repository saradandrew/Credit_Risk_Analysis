# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, different machine learning techniques were used to analyze credit card risk. RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms were used for oversampling while the ClusterCentroids algorithm was used for undersampling credit card data from obtained from LendingClub. Then, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were used for comparison measure.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
